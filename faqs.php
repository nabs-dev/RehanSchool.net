                        Our AI-enabled education system uses adaptive learning platforms that track each student's progress and adjust content difficulty accordingly. Students receive personalized learning paths, immediate feedback, and targeted support in areas where they need it most. Our facilitators use AI-generated insights to better understand student needs and tailor their teaching approaches. The technology doesn't replace human teachers but enhances their ability to provide effective, personalized education.

                        We use a holistic assessment framework that goes beyond traditional exams. Our approach includes project evaluations, portfolio assessments, presentations, peer reviews, and self-assessments. We also utilize AI-powered analytics to track progress in real-time, identifying areas of strength and opportunities for growth. Regular feedback sessions with facilitators ensure students understand their progress and next steps. This comprehensive approach allows us to assess not just academic knowledge but also critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and other essential skills.

                        Our admission process begins with an online application followed by an interactive assessment session. Rather than traditional entrance exams, we use engaging activities to evaluate a student's thinking process, creativity, and learning potential. We also conduct interviews with both students and parents to ensure alignment with our educational philosophy. We welcome students from diverse backgrounds and learning styles, as our personalized approach allows us to meet a wide range of educational needs.

                        We align with the core requirements of the national curriculum while significantly enhancing and expanding it.

                        While having access to a computer or tablet and internet connection at home is beneficial, it is not a requirement. We provide all necessary technology during school hours, and our campus has extended hours to ensure students can complete technology-based assignments. For families without home technology access, we offer solutions such as loaner devices and partnerships with community centers to provide internet access. We are committed to ensuring that technology access is not a barrier to receiving a quality education at Rehan School.

                        We are mindful of creating a healthy balance between technology use and other essential activities. Our schedule includes regular physical activity, hands-on projects, outdoor learning, and face-to-face collaboration. Technology is used purposefully as a tool for learning, not as a replacement for human interaction or physical activity. We follow research-based guidelines for age-appropriate screen time and teach students about digital wellness and responsible technology use.

We have specialized support staff, including educational psychologists and learning specialists, who work alongside our regular facilitators. Our AI-enabled platforms can adapt content and pacing to accommodate different learning styles and needs. We develop individualized learning plans for students who require additional support or enrichment, and we maintain regular communication with parents to ensure a collaborative approach to supporting each student's unique journey.
